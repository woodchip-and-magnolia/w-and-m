Starting from the kitchen table back in 2016, Woodchip & Magnolia has grown to the established luxury British design house it is today. <\/p><p> <\/p><p>The seeds for Nina’s career were sewn many years before. Aged just five, she told her school teacher that she was going to be a wallpaper designer and that’s exactly what she did after graduating from Leeds College of Art in 1997 with a BA (Hons) in Surface Pattern and Textile Design. And now, with her talented eye and daring use of colour and pattern, Nina is the driving creative force behind Woodchip & Magnolia, designing and curating bold, fearless and beautiful wallpaper, murals, fabric and paint.<\/p><p> <\/p><p>Nina’s creativity, together with Paul’s technical know-how, enables them to have complete control over the design and printing process from start to finish. Freed from the quarterly deadlines most design studios adhere to, their innovative digital process allows for complete creative expression throughout the traditionally structured seasons. And, flying the flag for British manufacturing and putting nature firmly at the heart of the business, Woodchip & Magnolia proudly produces all its own wallpaper and fabrics in-house to remain as eco-friendly and sustainable as possible. <\/p><p> <\/p><p>Inspired by her love for the natural world, Nina sources much of her inspiration from her doorstep in Lancashire. Every design has a story behind it and has been created to inspire and delight each customer. Alongside the dazzling designs developed in-house, Woodchip & Magnolia collaborates with leading creatives, including fashion designer Pearl Lowe and Fearne Cotton. Each collection taps into the designer’s passions and inspirations, and seamlessly combines interiors with the latest trends.<\/p>"
